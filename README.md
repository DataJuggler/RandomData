# RandomData
This project includes a zip file that contains a SQL Server database with 20,000 random member names and addresses, plus a list of adjectives, adverbs, nouns and verbs.

This project also includes tables for First Names, Last Names, Street addresses.

If you want to create more random members and addresses, this project was used to create the member database.

# Create a new SQL Server Database Named RandomData (or whatever name you wish).
Download this repo and extra the zip file contents. 

Execute the SQL Script RandomData.sql.

This will create the database schema and populate the tables.

I am working on a Random Story Generator is why I created this.
